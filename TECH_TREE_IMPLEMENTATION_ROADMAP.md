# Tech Tree Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Phases 1-3 shipped. **Phase 4 (Tech Tree UI) is the active blocker.** Phases 5-6 deferred.
**Priority:** High (Core MVP Feature)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks (phased approach)

## Quick status

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 — Enhanced Data Layer | ✅ done | `TechCategory.cs`, `TechGeneration.cs`, expanded `TechDefinition.cs`, `DefinitionsFactory.CreateTech()` (commits `f4f7ebd`, `5bf056b`) |
| 2 — Enhanced Tech Manager + integration + tests | ✅ done | `TechManager` prerequisites/era logic, `ResourceManager` tech bonuses, `Unit` requiredTech checks, Phase 2 integration tests (commits `0db3013`, `d80b1bf`, `bcc8daa`) |
| 3 — Gen 2-3 tech definitions | 🟡 partial | 16 Gen 0-1 techs defined in `GameBootstrap`. Gen 2-3 not yet wired. |
| 4 — Tech Tree UI | ⏳ next | UIShell currently shows procedural debug HUD only; no Tech Tree screen exists. |
| 5 — Gen 4 + balance | ⏳ deferred | Blocked on Phase 4. |
| 6 — Gen 5 (optional) | ⏳ deferred | Post-MVP. |

## 🎯 Goal

Implement the complete technology tree system (Gen 0-4) based on `TECH_TREE.md` framework, enabling:
- Progressive tech unlocks (60+ technologies)
- Branching research paths (Air/Ground/Tech)
- Era transitions (Gen 0 → Gen 4)
- Unit/district unlock requirements
- Global stat bonuses from techs

### Phase 2: Enhanced Tech Manager (Week 1-2) — ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Implement prerequisite checking, era transitions, and tech effects

#### Tasks:
1. **Expand TechManager.cs**
   - [x] Add `allTechs` (full tree)

---

### Phase 4: UI Layer (Week 3) — ⏳ NEXT (active blocker)

**Goal:** Create Tech Tree UI screen with selection and tooltips

**Status note:** `UIShell.cs` currently renders a procedural debug HUD only — no Tech Tree screen exists. This is the next major work item.

#### Tasks:
1. **Tech Tree Screen**
   - [ ] Create UI panel (Canvas + scroll view)
   - [ ] Display available technologies (grid or list)
   - [ ] Show current research + progress bar

   - [ ] "Select Research" button for each available tech

2. **Tech Tooltip System**
   - [ ] Display on hover: name, cost, prerequisites, unlocks, effects
   - [ ] Visual indication: researched (green), available (white), locked (gray)
   - [ ] Show prerequisite connections (optional: graph view)

3. **Integration**
   - [ ] Hotkey to open Tech Tree (default: T)
   - [ ] Click tech → `TechManager.SetResearch()`
   - [ ] Update UI when tech completes (event-driven)

4. **Visual Polish**
   - [ ] Add tech icons (placeholders OK for MVP)
   - [ ] Color-code by category (Power=blue, Mecha=green, Weapons=red, etc.)
   - [ ] Generation separators (visual grouping)

**Deliverable:** Functional Tech Tree UI screen

---

### Phase 5: Gen 4 + Polish (Week 4)

   - [ ] VF-1S Super Valkyrie (requires FAST Pack Engineering I)
   - [ ] VF-1A Strike Valkyrie (requires FAST Pack Engineering I)
   - [ ] Excalibur Mk II (requires Excalibur Mk II Program)

3. **Balance Pass**
   - [ ] Playtest all three paths (Air, Ground, Tech)
   - [ ] Ensure no dominant strategy
   - [ ] Verify science costs scale appropriately
   - [ ] Check tech completion timing (Gen 0 by turn 5, Gen 1 by turn 15, Gen 2 by turn 25, etc.)

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update TECH_TREE.md with any changes
   - [ ] Add tech tree diagram (optional)

- [ ] Create next-gen units (if applicable)
- [ ] Add campaign scenario support (pre-unlocked techs for specific missions)

**Note:** Gen 5 is NOT required for MVP. Consider post-1.0 expansion.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (EditMode)
```csharp
[Test]
public void TechPrerequisites_BlocksUnavailableTechs()
{
    // Arrange
    var reactorMk2 = CreateTech(..., prerequisites: reactorMk1);
    var techManager = new TechManager();

    // Act
    bool canResearch = techManager.IsTechAvailable(reactorMk2);

    // Assert
    Assert.IsFalse(canResearch, "Should not be able to research Reactor Mk II without Mk I");
}

[Test]
public void EraTransition_UnlocksNextGeneration()
{
    // Arrange
    var protocultureDiscovery = CreateTech(...);
    protocultureDiscovery.allowsEraTransition = true;
    var techManager = new TechManager();
    techManager.currentGeneration = TechGeneration.Gen0;

    // Act
    techManager.SetResearch(protocultureDiscovery);
    techManager.AddScience(1000); // Force completion

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(TechGeneration.Gen1, techManager.currentGeneration);
}
```

### Integration Tests (Play Mode)
- [ ] Start new game, research Protoculture Discovery, verify Gen 1 unlocks
- [ ] Research Transformation Engineering I, verify VF-0 can be produced
- [ ] Complete Reactor Mk II, verify +15 Protoculture per turn applied
- [ ] Research all Gen 3 techs, verify no crashes or missing dependencies

### Balance Testing
- [ ] Play full match focusing Air path (VF-1 rush)
- [ ] Play full match focusing Ground path (Destroid wall)
- [ ] Play full match focusing Tech path (economy/science)
- [ ] Verify all paths reach victory condition in ~40-60 turns

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

**MVP Tech Tree is complete when:**
- [ ] All Gen 0-3 techs implemented and testable
- [ ] Prerequisite system prevents researching locked techs
- [ ] Era transitions work (Gen 0 → Gen 1 → Gen 2 → Gen 3)
- [ ] Unit production checks tech requirements
- [ ] Tech effects apply to resources and units
- [ ] UI allows selecting and viewing techs
- [ ] All three strategic paths are viable
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes

**Stretch Goals:**
- [ ] Gen 4 fully implemented
- [ ] Visual tech tree graph (Civ6-style)
- [ ] Tech icons for all techs
- [ ] Gen 5 defined for future expansion

---

## 🚧 Known Challenges

### Challenge 1: Balancing Science Costs
**Problem:** Hard to predict turn timing without extensive playtesting
**Mitigation:**
- Start with formula-based costs (Gen X = 10 * (1.5^X))
- Playtest and adjust
- Make costs easily tweakable (ScriptableObject)

### Challenge 2: Unit Upgrade in Field
**Problem:** Applying tech bonuses to existing units
**Mitigation:**
- Store original stats in UnitDefinition
- Apply multipliers/bonuses when tech completes
- Units keep bonuses even if "downgraded" (no tech loss mechanic)

### Challenge 3: UI Complexity
**Problem:** 60+ techs is a lot to display
**Mitigation:**
- Filter by generation (show only current + next)
- Filter by category (Power/Mecha/Weapons tabs)
- Search/filter functionality

### Challenge 4: Save/Load
**Problem:** Need to persist researched techs
**Mitigation:**
- Store list of `techId` strings in save file
- Reconstruct `researchedTechs` list on load
- Reapply all tech effects to resources/units

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Must be implemented first:**
- [x] ResourceManager (Science accumulation)
- [x] TurnManager (Per-turn science from cities)
- [x] City/District system (Science yields from Lab districts)
- [x] Enhanced TechDefinition (this roadmap)
- [x] Enhanced TechManager (this roadmap)

**Blocks:**
- [ ] Unit production UI (needs tech unlock checks)
- [ ] Advanced units (VF-1 line blocked by Transformation Engineering II)
- [ ] Late-game balance (needs full tech tree to test)

---

## 📅 Suggested Timeline

**Week 1:** Phase 1-2 (Enhanced data layer, TechManager)
**Week 2:** Phase 3 (Gen 2-3 definitions, balancing)
**Week 3:** Phase 4 (UI implementation)
**Week 4:** Phase 5 (Gen 4, polish, testing)

**Total:** ~4 weeks for complete Gen 0-4 tech tree system

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Review TECH_TREE.md** - Familiarize with all 60+ technologies
2. **Create TechGeneration and TechCategory enums** - Add to Data namespace
3. **Expand TechDefinition.cs** - Add all new fields from Phase 1
4. **Create CreateTech() factory method** - Enable rapid tech creation
5. **Define Gen 0 techs** - Start small (3-4 techs) to test system
6. **Test prerequisite logic** - Verify TechManager.IsTechAvailable() works

**After that, proceed phase-by-phase through this roadmap.**
